          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-primary mb-4">🪑 The "Sitting Disease": Combatting 9-5 Desk Stiffness</h2>
          <p class="mb-4">If you live in Bangalore, chances are you spend a significant portion of your day sitting—whether it's at a desk in start-up hub Koramangala or stuck in traffic on the Outer Ring Road. This sedentary lifestyle leads to what health experts call "sitting disease": <strong>tight hips, weak glutes, and chronic back pain.</strong></p>
          <p>Traditional gyms offer a solution, but let's be honest: running on a treadmill for 45 minutes can be mind-numbingly boring. This is where <strong class="text-primary">Mixed Martial Arts (MMA)</strong> changes the game. Unlike a static gym workout, MMA forces your body to move in every plane of motion. You're twisting, sprawling, pushing, and pulling. It's the ultimate antidote to the stiffness that comes from an 8-hour coding marathon.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-primary mb-4">😤 Stress Relief: Why Hitting Pads Beats Hitting 'Send'</h2>
          <p class="mb-4">We all know the feeling. A production bug at 5 PM, a client escalation, or just the general hum of deadline pressure. Cortisol levels spike, and you carry that stress home.</p>
          <p>MMA provides a visceral outlet for that stress. There is something profoundly therapeutic about hitting a heavy bag or focusing entirely on a complex BJJ leverage point. For that hour on the mats, you cannot think about Jira tickets or quarterly targets. <strong>You are 100% present.</strong> It's "active meditation" for the high-functioning brain.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-primary mb-4">🛡️ Can You Train MMA Without Getting Injured?</h2>
          <p class="mb-4">A common misconception is that MMA training means getting punched in the face daily. This couldn't be further from the truth. At <strong class="text-primary">Wolf Academy India</strong>, we distinguish between "fighting" and "training."</p>
          <p>Our curriculum is designed for safety first. <strong>90% of our students are working professionals</strong> who need to go to work the next day without a black eye. You learn the techniques—striking, grappling, defense—in a controlled environment. Sparring is completely optional and only introduced when you are ready.</p>
